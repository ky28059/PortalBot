# PortalBot
Bot for cross pollination and epicness.

### What does it do?
PortalBot links two channels together using the power of portals! Use `portal open [channel]` to open a portal, and
if it is approved in the other channel then messages sent in one channel will be broadcast to the other using the amazing 
power of magic!

(disclaimer: under the hood, PortalBot uses webhooks instead of magic to link channels. Read about everything PortalBot
imitates in a message [here](https://github.com/ky28059/PortalBot/blob/main/bot.ts#L248-L257).)

### Why?
Because it's fun! Also, it encourages what I refer to as "cross pollination" between friend groups on different servers
which is always an upside.
